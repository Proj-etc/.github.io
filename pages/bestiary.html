  <h1>Men of Letters</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Men of Letters are "preceptors, observers, beholders, chroniclers"
    of mysteries not easily explainable or known to men.<br><br>
    They had knowledge of mysteries of the supernatural and many arcane arts like
    alchemy.<br><br>
    They also considered hunters to be inferior to them. Thus,
    their order only shares its secrets to the most elite hunters they
    deem to be worthy.</p>
