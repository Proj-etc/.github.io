  <h1>Men of Letters</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Men of Letters are "preceptors, observers, beholders, chroniclers" of
    mysteries not easily explainable or known to men.<br /><br />
    They had knowledge of mysteries of the supernatural and many arcane arts
    like alchemy.<br /><br />
    They also considered hunters to be inferior to them. Thus, their order only
    shares its secrets to the most elite hunters they deem to be worthy.
